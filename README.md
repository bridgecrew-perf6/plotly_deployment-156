# Belly Button Biodiversity Project
Bootcamp Mod 12

## Overview
This project was designed to provide a data dashboard displaying several chart
types based on user selected input. Using a simple index page (html and
bootstrap) to display the charts, JavaScript powers the event handlers, user
input, and chart creation.

### Resources
* index.html: html, css, js, bootstrap, d3
* style.css: image of bacteria
* data.js: json data (provided)
* charts.js: d3, plotly

## Results
The index page is simple and clean, thanks to Bootstrap's grid system. The event
handlers (d3) make selecting the sample from the dropdown box easy and highly
responsive. Plotly allows for the creation of the three charts in a
straightforward fashion with minimal coding.  

The horizontal bar chart caused the most challenge, though not much, in
requiring the labels to be reversed so that the bacteria were presented in
descending order - needing to reverse both the data and the labels.  

The gauge chart is, at this point, a fancy way of presenting a single data
point. Such a chart could present more information, but it currently displays
more chrome than data.  

The bubble chart can be very useful. At the moment, the data presented is not
particularly salient for the viewer. What is being presented is not entirely
clear and the viewer needs to decipher what information is being presented. As
this project is primarily about the process of creating the charts, this is
acceptable. If, however, this was for an actual presentation of information, a
lot of thought would need to go into making this chart more useful for its
audience.  

## Summary
This project expands significantly on the previous project and requires an added
degree of effort and sophistication in the presentation of the material. Given
that each of these projects must be completed within one week, this was a
significant and appropriate increase in difficulty. This continues to lay the
groundwork for a complete and robust presentation of data.
